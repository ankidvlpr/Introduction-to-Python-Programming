# Please write a function named list_of_stars, which takes a list of integers as its argument.
# The function should print out lines of star characters. 
# The numbers in the list specify how many stars each line should contain.

# For example, with the function call list_of_stars([3, 7, 1, 1, 2]) the following should be printed out:

# Sample output
# ***
# *******
# *
# *
# **

def list_of_stars(my_list: list):
    for i in my_list:
        print(i*"*")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    list1 = [3, 7, 1, 1, 2]
    list_of_stars(list1)
