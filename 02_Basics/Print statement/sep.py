# The argument sep="" is a keyword argument, and its name is short for separator. 
# It specifies that the other arguments should now be separated by an empty string. 
# You can set the separator to any string you like. For example, if you wanted each argument on a separate line,
# you could set the separator to "\n", which is the newline character:

name = "Mark"
age = 37
print("Hi", name, "your age is", age, "years", sep="\n")
