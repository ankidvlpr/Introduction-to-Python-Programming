# Please write a function named create_tuple(x: int, y: int, z: int),
# which takes three integers as its arguments, and creates and returns a tuple based on the following criteria:

# The first element in the tuple is the smallest of the arguments
# The second element in the tuple is the greatest of the arguments
# The third element in the tuple is the sum of the arguments
# An example of its use:


# Sample output
# (-1, 5, 7)
