# Introduction to Python Programming

**A hands-on, exercise-driven repository for building programming fundamentals and problem-solving skill.**

## About this repository (Part 1 of 2)

This repository is the **first part** of a two-repo learning series:

1. **Introduction to Programming** (this repo) — fundamentals, core patterns, and problem solving.  
2. **Advanced Python Programming** — (separate repo) advanced techniques, libraries, and projects.

In this repo you will find a curated set of exercises from **easy → medium → hard**. Each exercise is chosen with a specific purpose: to strengthen your mental models and sharpen algorithmic thinking, not just to produce code.

## How I work (short)

- Read the problem and visualize a small example.
- Try solving it independently for 15–30 minutes.
- If stuck, ask a focused question and iterate.
- Produce a clean solution and add a short note explaining the key idea.

This process is intentionally disciplined: struggle, diagnose, fix, and record.

## What’s in this repo

This repository is organized by programming topics. Each topic folder contains multiple practice problems and their solutions.

The purpose is not just solving questions, but strengthening:

- Logical thinking  
- Pattern recognition  
- Mental visualization of code  
- Independent problem-solving ability  

This repo grows topic-by-topic as I progress deeper into programming.
